            </div>
            <p>Being a mentor means being able to make yourself available for
              someone so that you can support them through any problems they have
              and also advise them from your experience. Being a mentor also means
               keeping your mentee’s priority in mind so they can improve. A good
               mentor should be genuinely interested and wanting to help their
               mentor. Lastly a mentor can come in all shapes and sizes so it can
               be anyone that you feel fills the description.
             </br>
             </br>
              Being emotionally intelligent is a big part of being an amazing
              mentor. Any time you become a mentor for someone, you'll find
              yourself getting to know their unique personality, their wants and
              needs, the experience
             </br>
             </br>
              The best mentors know how to unlock this information by asking the
              right questions, reading their mentee's body language, being
              open-minded, and even acknowledging and controlling their own
              emotions.

              <h2 id = "leader">Leadership</h2>
            </div>
            <p>To be a leader means to set an example for others of what it is
               to be a leader and to make them better leaders that you once were.
               Leadership is also a way to postivitley leave an impact on
               people's lives and teach them life values that will reside with
               them. Leadership is to promote the good things to do in life and
               to find yourself as an open person to give other comfortability

            </div>
            <p>To be a good mentor you promote positivity. Life is short. Why
              waste time on negative behaviors that don't align with your
              business' moral compass? I proactively encourage my team to think
              positively--All. The. Time. Even when things seem to be spinning
              out of control or we didn't achieve the result we anticipated,
              positive thinking will eventually cultivate positive outcomes.
              Setting weekly, monthly and yearly positive intentions as a group
              will help to align your team and ensure that everyone is facing
              toward the same North Star.</p>

            <p>To be a good mentor you motivate your mentee to push forward. Do
            these following things
              <ol>
                <li class = "list">Limit the amount of time or effort that you’re asking for</li>

            </div>
            <p>To be a good mentor you promote a growth mindset. A growth
              mindset is when people know they can develop their skills and
              talents through effort and persistence, as well as being receptive
              to lessons and feedback. They generally believe they can improve
              through hard work and trying new learning methods. You can do
              these following things:
              <ol>

                <li  class = "list">Allow Time for Goal-Based Journaling</li>
                <li  class = "list">Say “Yet” More Often</li>
